The LLVM infrastructure is a popular compiler ecosystem widely used in the tech industry and academia. This technology is crucial for both experienced and aspiring compiler developers looking to make an impact in the field. Written by Quentin Colombet, a veteran LLVM contributor and architect of the GlobalISel framework, this book provides a primer on the main aspects of LLVM, with an emphasis on its backend infrastructure; that is, everything needed to transform the intermediate representation (IR) produced by frontends like Clang into assembly code and object files.
You’ll learn how to write an optimizing code generator for a toy backend in LLVM. The chapters will guide you step by step through building this backend while exploring key concepts, such as the ABI, cost model, and register allocation. You’ll also find out how to express these concepts using LLVM's existing infrastructure and how established backends address these challenges. Furthermore, the book features code snippets that demonstrate the actual APIs.
By the end of this book, you’ll have gained a deeper understanding of LLVM. The concepts presented are expected to remain stable across different LLVM versions, making this book a reliable quick reference guide for understanding LLVM.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
To follow the instructions in this book, you need LLVM 20 installed on your system, running on Windows, macOS, or Linux operating systems.

Navigate in the different `chX` directory and look at the examples provided and do the exercises when applicable.
Each directory has its own README.md with specific directions.

Note:
The exercises have been tested with the open source repository of LLVM at the Git hash 424c2d9b7e4d from February 13th 2025. Which is LLVM 20.1.1.

Some of the exercises interact directly with the LLVM C++ API. This API has no stability guarantee therefore it is possible that newer or older version of LLVM will not work with these exercises.

For the exercices that requires a version of LLVM handy, if you build your own make sure to use the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` cmake variable to set the install path, then build the `install` target.

Then, you will need to provide this path to CMake in the different exercise.

Follow the READMEs in the different directories when you get there.

* Page 6: Under the heading _Identifying the right version of the tools_, in step 1 the hyperlink on the URL [https://releases.llvm.org/] in the digital formats redirects to [https://www.python.org/downloads/]. Please copy and paste the link [https://releases.llvm.org/] in the browser to navigate to the correct webpage.
* Page 11: In the command `$ git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm/project.git`, the URL should be `https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git`. Therefore, the first line becomes `$ git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git`.
* Page 71: In the descriptipn below _Figure 3.4_, the sentence "Because of that, inserting a store in A and **reloading in B** means that the whole dotted region needs to play nicely with this memory location." should be "Because of that, inserting a store in A and **reloading in C** means that the whole dotted region needs to play nicely with this memory location."
* Page 106: In _Figure 4.6_, the block at the center labelled as "excluding" should be "exiting".
* Page 361: The term `MCInstrPrinter` should be `MCInstPrinter`.
